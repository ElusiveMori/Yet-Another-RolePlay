## Foreword

I would like you to read this, but if you'd like to skip to the actual wiki, just scroll below.

YARP is a project made for the WC3 RP community, and I had no other intentions other than to give the people of this rather small, but dedicated community, a better map to build and roleplay on. Everything I have done is a direct result of my own and other people's frustrations with older maps, and I am trying to address as many of your suggestion as possible.

But, no man walks a path like this alone. This project would have been impossible without the help and support of my friends and lots of people from the community. Everyone who has given me feedback, expressed their words of gratitude or concern, everyone who has helped me find content for the map, given me advice or offered valuable suggestions is just as instrumental to the creation of YARP.

## Wiki

* And many other people that helped me make this project a reality!
