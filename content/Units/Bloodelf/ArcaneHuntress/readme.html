<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I decided to make a blood-elf version of my mage huntress... Well, here it is.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;After the Sunwell was corrupted by the Scourge, the mage huntresses of Quel&#039;thalas started to feel the thirst for magic. Their &quot;talent&quot; was most useful now - the mage huntresses, after slaying the magi they hunt, could tap the magic from the dead bodies to use for themselves. Thirsting for mana, the mage huntresses are now more dangerous than ever...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<b>Update</b>(29.01.2010): Whoops. Seems like I forgot to add the portrait. <br />
<br />
Special thanks to my Frankster, who&#039;s blood-elf models were a huge inspiration for me.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you use this model in your project, please check out this icon made my Mr.Goblin for it:<br />
