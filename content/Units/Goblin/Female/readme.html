<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Female Goblin<br />
<br />
Model by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Descriptions:<br />
A female goblin.<br />
This model could be useful as a villager, an NPC or maybe a tier 1 unit if you add some weapon attachments.<br />
<br />
For the facial and body structure, I was a little inspired from the female goblins in World of Warcraft, especially the smaller upward crooked nose and the botox lips.<br />
<br />
Model descriptions:<br />
The entire goblin mesh is heavily modified from the Harpy.<br />
Animations taken from Demoness, Sylvanas, Ogre, Watcher/Runner and Grunt.<br />
External portrait model included with Demoness Portrait animations. <br />
100% ingame textures.<br />
<br />
YOU MUST GIVE ME CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP!!!<br />
<br />
Feel free to edit this model for your projects as long as you credit me for the model you based it from.<br />
<br />
MDX files can have any path, though the portrait model must be in the same path as the main model.<br />
<br />

HINT: You&#039;ll might need to re-scale her in world editor to 0.60 or 0.65 if you wish to make her as small as the other goblins.<br />

UPDATE:<br />
Fixed the shoulders on the Spell Slam animation thanks to Mephestrial&#039;s tip.<br />
