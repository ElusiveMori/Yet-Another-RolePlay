<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dwarven artisan from Ironforge, skilled in the arts of architecture. <br />
<br />
I originally made this model for my race, in the race-building contest, but I decided I wont have time to finish and dropped out. <br />
Special thanks to Dionesiist for creating the hat and giving me constant advice.<br />
The model has no attack animation, because you can&#039;t really attack your enemies with a feather pen. And the portrait looks better in-game than in Magos. <br />
<br />
Give me and Dionesiist credits if you use this model in your map.<br />
