<h2>Description</h2>
<p><b><i>&quot;Once students of the Conjurers of Azeroth, the Mages of the Kirin Tor had been forced to discover untapped magical forces to command during the Second War against the ruthless Orcs. Although masters of their arts, the Conjurers who fell during the First War were unprepared for the rigors of warfare. Determined to avoid a similar fate, the Mages had undertaken a regimen that is equally demanding on both the body and soul, thus dedicating themselves to the command of the more aggressive and destructive spells which the Conjurers lack. Whether in their sanctum at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran or on the many battlefields of Lordaeron, the Mages are resolute in their efforts to defend the people.&quot;</i></b><br />

Another remake of a retro unit, this time the Human Mage from Warcraft II! As there is no good model for this guy yet, I&#039;ve decided to do my own take on him based on the Necromancer. I&#039;ve tried to remain faithful to the original design as possible, both in the ingame portrayal as well as some of the artwork from that era, but with my own artistic tweaks here and there. Hopefully he should look pleasing.<br />
<br />
This model uses ingame textures, so no need to worry about texture paths. Just simply import both the model and the portrait into your custom map!<br />
<br />
If you want to use this model then feel free to do that, provided that you&#039;ll give credit to me in return.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 1:</b><br />
Adjusted the portrait&#039;s camera.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 2:</b><br />
Updated for approval. The ball on the staff has been replaced with a billboarded mesh. In addition, the model now has seperate Attack and Spell animations.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 3:</b><br />
Recalculated extents.<br />
