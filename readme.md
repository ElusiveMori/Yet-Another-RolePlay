# About YARP

__YARP__ (Yet Another RolePlay) is a Warcraft III map heavily inspired by sandbox maps like SotDRP and RoTRP.
These maps provided the players with many useful commands which exposed a lot of functionality of the WC3 engine directly to the players. Using these commands, the players are able to create rather impressive builds and environments for usage in their roleplay. YARP follows in this direction, seeking to improve upon what SotDRP and RoTRP had laid down before.

YARP does not use any of the code from SotDRP or RoTRP, nor any object data from these maps. It is written completely from scratch, using Zinc (an extension to vJass) for triggers and GMSI for object data generation.

# Mission statement

If there are already sandbox maps out there, then why do we need another one?

While RoTRP does provide a plenty of tools, there is always room for improvement, and YARP in particular strives to bring better user experience to the players, by making the building process easier and more convenient. YARP also seeks to extend functionality by providing features that are absent from older sandbox maps.
