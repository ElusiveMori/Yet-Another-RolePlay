<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Drealord (Pre-Beta Look-A-Like)<br />
<br />
Model by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Descriptions:<br />
I&#039;ve got inspired by the Dreadlords from the alpha and pre-beta versions of Warcraft III, so I&#039;ve made a little remake from it to make this model look similar.<br />
Based on the Dreadlord model with a new walk animation, because skirt looked a bit awkward when the old walk animation was played.<br />
And all textures are ingame, so don&#039;t worry about special paths.<br />
<br />
No custom icons are needed since the ingame Dreadlord icon fits very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU MUST GIVE ME CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP!!!<br />
<br />
Feel free to edit this model for your projects as long as you credit me for the model you based it from.<br />
<br />
Enjoy! <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

<br />
Also, I&#039;d like thank Dionesiist for his hint on how to attach the skirt part to the leg part of the rig.<br />
