<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The first Caster Troll of the Wildland/Dark Alliance I&#039;ve been trying to create. Like all Grunt-tier Trolls, he is a little stockier than the higher tier Forest Trolls.<br />
<br />
Specializing in Dark and Fire magic, the Shadow Priest casts:<br />
Warmth - A weak health regeneration buff, that can be used on his allies. (Spell)<br />
Affliction - A single-target missile, that can slow the movement speed of his enemies (Spell Attack Slam)<br />
Determination - A channelled AOE buff, increasing the movement speed of any nearby allies within a certain range (Spell One)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Shadow Priest&#039;s role is to stay at a safe distance, buffing allies, and debuffing strong target enemies. With his low health and damage, the Shadow Priest is still invaluable later on, once he gains access to Determination, which allows the raiding party accompanying him to strike quickly in the night, or make a hasty retreat.<br />
That&#039;s MY use for him anyway.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use or edit this model as much as you like, so long as you credit me for my work.<br />
