<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Another Forest Troll, for a race I&#039;m currently calling the &#039;Wildland Alliance&#039;. Acting as the Footsoldier for this group, the Pillager has pilfered his armor from corpses and caravans, scavenging the very best of what he could find.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the Pillager is mainly a one-on-one fighter, able to be upgraded to do slight AOE damage on hit, and activate a temporary armor boost. With their massive swords, the Pillagers are a force to be reckoned with when confronted on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use or edit this model as much as you like, so long as I&#039;m given credit for my work.<br />
