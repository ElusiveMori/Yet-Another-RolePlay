<p>A powerful, mysterious mercenary hero, carrying a massive Halberd. Specializing in large-scale combat, the Shadeweaver has access to dark magicks, capable of staining his skin black, and increasing his size a considerable amount.

As he levels up, the Shadeweaver has access to a number of abilities, including:<br />
A taunt, to draw fire from his allies - Spell/Spell Alternate<br />
A strike capable of knocking an enemy directly infront of him, into the air - Spell Throw/Spell Throw Alternate<br />
An AOE damage ability, slicing through any nearby enemy units, and slowing them briefly - Spell Slam/ Spell Slam Alternate<br />
Shade Form, as described above.<br />
