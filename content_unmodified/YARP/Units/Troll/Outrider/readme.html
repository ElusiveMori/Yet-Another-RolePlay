<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The first of the Second Tier of Forest Troll models.<br />
<br />
The Outrider is a mobile warrior, able to ride to the front of the battlefield, and let loose an inspiring Battlecry. With his brutal mace, the Outrider is a nightmare atop fangs and claws, able to run down and destroy the siege weaponry of the larger factions with ease.<br />

Feel free to use and edit this model, so long as I&#039;m given credit for my work.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I&#039;ve made the wolf bigger, and the troll smaller. I&#039;ve also changed the size of his hands. Also fixed the camera.<br />
