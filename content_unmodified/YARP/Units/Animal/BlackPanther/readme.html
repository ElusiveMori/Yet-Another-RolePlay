<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Panther<br />
<br />
Made by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Model were modified from the Huntress model. Attack animation transferred from the Timber Wolf model. Even though the attack animation on this model is a bit odd, it&#039;s better than the attack animations from the old tiger models. The Panther uses ingame textures.<br />
<br />
