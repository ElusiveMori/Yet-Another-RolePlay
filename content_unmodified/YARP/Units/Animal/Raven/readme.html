<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raven<br />
Model by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Descriptions:<br />
The raven (can also be used as a crow) has a good use for various types of maps, such as myths, stories and even real-life-type maps.<br />
<br />
Based on the War Eagle model (one of Beastmaster&#039;s summons). It uses a texture from a raven, wich can be seen in the Orc Campaignscreen. The legs&#039; texture comes from Druid Storm Crow Form with darker tinting. So this model uses in-game textures.<br />
Portrait camera is built in the model.<br />
<br />
YOU MUST GIVE ME CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP!!!<br />

<br />
No certain paths, because this model does not require custom textures.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
- Fixed the colors on the legs so they don&#039;t look plain black.<br />
- Optimised the filesize, making the model smaller.<br />
