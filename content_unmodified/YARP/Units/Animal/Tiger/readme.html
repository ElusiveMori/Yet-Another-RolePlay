<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tiger<br />
<br />
Made by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Models were modified from the Huntress model. Attack animation transferred from the Timber Wolf model. Even though the attack animation on these models is a bit odd, it&#039;s better than the attack animations from the old tiger models. And yes, I&#039;ve made the Tiger texture (coloring, recoloring and stuff).<br />
<br />
Texture is updated so the Tiger&#039;s colors will make it look more like a real Tiger.<br />
All my predator kitties (except Panther) are resubmitted seperately to avoid the automatic-portrait-naming issue that&#039;s caused by the upload feature.<br />
<br />
YOU MUST GIVE ME CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP!!!<br />
