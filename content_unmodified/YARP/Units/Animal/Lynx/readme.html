<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cavman made a Wow-esque Eversong Lynx from one of my cat models (which I permitted), and he wanted me to upload it so I can add it in my Big Kitty Modelpack.<br />
And I like the idea and agreed to his offer. =D<br />

YOU MUST GIVE US BOTH CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP.<br />
