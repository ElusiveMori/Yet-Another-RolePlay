Description:<br />
What else can I say that she is a female version of the Captain?<br />
<br />
Base model is the Demoness with transfered animations from the Footman, plus some extras (like Attack Slam for a shield bash ability and Dissipate for used if the unit will be a hero).<br />
External portrait model is included if you wish to make the character move her head when she talks, though you can (if you want) still use the built-in non-talking version for file size or if you use a custom footman texture that doesn&#039;t fit on the external portrait very well.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
Cavman was generous to give the model a new wrap on the back, made the balls billboarded and tweaked the animations on the sword.<br />
And I have edited the proportions now to make her less thin.<br />
<br />
Extra note:<br />
Cavman was the first to come up with a feminine version, though he based directly on the Footman model (which is quite difficult to make it look feminine).<br />
So I didn&#039;t come up with the idea first, but I was tempted to make my own version.<br />
<br />
