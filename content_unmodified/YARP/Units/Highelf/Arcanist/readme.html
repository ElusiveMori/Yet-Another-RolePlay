<h2>Arcanist Hero</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A heroic version of the Sorceress, inspired by my own Arcanist entry into the Hero Contest.<br />
Includes the attachment points:<br />
Orb First<br />
Orb Second<br />
Orb Third for any &quot;Sphere&quot; spells, like the Blood Mage uses. For best results, I suggest using five attachment points, including Hand Right and Hand Left.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to use or edit this model however you please, so long as you credit me for my work.<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
This is not actually FOR the Hero Contest.<br />
<br />
<b>Keywords:</b><br />
Sorceress, Mage, Caster, Hero</p>
