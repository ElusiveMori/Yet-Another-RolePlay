<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Another option for a Sorceress type of unit, this is based on the Villagerwoman with a Cleric-ish look. The animations for attack and channel were took and adapted from the priest and paladin. The model counts with inner Portrait.<br />
<br />
This model is in a combo with their own Priest and <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/blacksunspellbreaker.285416/" class="internalLink">Spellbreaker </a>variants.<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
<br />
Blood Emitters ajusted on the floor level. <br />
Sleeves moving a bit more on the Stand Victory animation.<br />
Dress &quot;Sunk&quot; on Death animation. &lt;-Looks ok for me in normal game view, can&#039;t ensure that on Cinematic angles.<br />
Minor face movement added on Stand, Attack, Channel.</p>
