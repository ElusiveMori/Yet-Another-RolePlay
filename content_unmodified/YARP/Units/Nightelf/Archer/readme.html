<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This one was going to be a simple edit of the archer, changing the weird potato sack boots and cleaning the wrapping on the arrow and bow, and it snowballed.<br />
<br />
Is based on the same body that the Lynxrider. Bow and arrow were copy/reversed/pasted to the sides with better wrapping, the bowstring was added using the unused string on the ballista skin.<br />
<br />
The bundle has a set of arrows, from the basic missile to any upgrade like Fire/Ice/Poison arrows.<br />
<br />
ps.<br />
<br />
Yes i known about the error with the WoW female archer main leg... MAYbe i&#039;ll change it later.<br />
<br />
Update 1: Added movement on the cape during Walk Fast animation, and the Bow is now higher during Stand and Stand -2.<br />
<br />
Update 2: Night Elven version added.<br />
<br />
Update 3: Corrected an error in the knee mesh, changed the blood particles on the Night Elf model to NE blood, and added Human version.</p>
