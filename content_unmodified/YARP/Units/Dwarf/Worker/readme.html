<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dwarven Workers, capable of switching roles at their Town Hall. One being a builder; and capable enough miner; the other being a woodsman, better equipped to harvest lumber.<br />
<br />
This Dwarven labourer can also arm themselves for battle at their nearest Barracks, becoming a Guardsman.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use and/or edit this model as much as you like, but remember to credit me.<br />

EDIT:<br />
Fixed an issue with the Lumberer.<br />
