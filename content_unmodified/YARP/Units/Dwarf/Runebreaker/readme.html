<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Descending from the mountains, these reclusive Dwarves have become brutal and savage; wielding powerful runic magic against their enemies. Immune to spells, and capable of manipulating magic itself, these powerful, savage mountain men have pledged themselves to serve the Alliance as Spellbreakers.<br />
