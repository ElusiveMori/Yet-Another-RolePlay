<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Another model made for a request. Older one though. Based off the Warden model. The animations have been changed slightly, and the skin is custom. Most of what&#039;s there is on one skin so it can be easily reskined. As I stated in my Shaman Female model, this falls under the orc category, so it has the same thing.<br />
<br />
Have fun and give credit if used.<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to add. If you want to use the skin unedited in the creation of your own Orc models and want to upload them to the hive, you have my permision to upload my skin with your model. Or a redone version of the skin, as long as you atleast mention me.<br />
