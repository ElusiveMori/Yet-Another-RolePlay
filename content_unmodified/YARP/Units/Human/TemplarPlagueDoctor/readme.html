<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Another of my Templar models; this time it&#039;s a mad Plague Doctor/Healer, out to spread the Plague. As I&#039;d worked on this model I realized he has a very &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;ish vibe to him, so I ran with it.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use and edit this model, so long as you credit me.<br />
