<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For anyone that had seen my Model Preview thread then you know this has been in existance for a while. Well now it&#039;s released. The Female Bandit, and <b>Female Bandit Spearthrower</b>. I followed the same kind of process that DvO did with his female Footies this time, so the mesh is based off of the Demoness. <br />
<br />
They use all ingame skins. Give credit if used and have fun with it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Mr. Goblin is awesome and made an Icon for this model.<br />
