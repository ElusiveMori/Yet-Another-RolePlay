<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Captain with added cape animations.<br />
Has new animations:<br />
Attack Slam, Spell and Dissipate.<br />
<br />
Fixed unwrapped texture un the right arm.<br />
<br />
Cape animations are not perfect, i make them with war3 model editor.<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
Changed &#039;attack slam&#039; animation to &#039;attack slam defend&#039;<br />
so it can play while using the defend ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: Geosets are now merged which lowers its numbers so the model will work better ingame.<br />
<br />
Update 2: Significantly reduced the model size.<br />
<br />
