<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Had this model on my hard drive for a while. In the smae vein that some of my other recent models have been. This is the Female Peasant (With showing cleavege for you complaining horny sons of b&#039;s that say it isn&#039;t female unless their boobs are hanging out.)<br />
<br />
Based off of the High Elf Peasent model with a heavily modified chest and a modified Villager Woman&#039;s head. Has all the propper animations to be a worker unit and the proper death sounds. Give credit if used and have fun with it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Mr. Goblin is awesome and made an Icon for this model.<br />
