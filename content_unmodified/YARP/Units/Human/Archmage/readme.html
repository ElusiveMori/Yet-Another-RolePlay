Description:<br />
Ever wanted to use the Archmage without the horse?<br />
Now you can by using this model made by me.<br />
<br />
Model description:<br />
I started with the Wc3 Necromancer by removing head, book,<br />
knives and staff. Then I gave the model an Archmage head and<br />
an Archmage staff. I also changed the UV so it uses in-game<br />
textures. And I also gave the model different emitters for<br />
attacks and spells.<br />
<br />
YOU MUST GIVE ME CREDITS IF YOU USE THIS MODEL IN YOUR MAP!!!<br />
<br />
Feel free to edit this model for your projects as long as you credit me for the model you based it from.<br />
<br />

Directories:<br />
Since this model doesn&#039;t use any custom textures, you don&#039;t need<br />
any required paths.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
- Glow on the staff is properly billboarded.<br />
- Added Dissipate animation.<br />
- Geosets are properly merged.<br />
