<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Footman with a Spear...<br />
And NO, the animation is NOT similar to a Felguard...<br />
Most animation is edited from the standard Footman/Bandit model...<br />
However, &#039;Attack - 1&#039; and &#039;Attack - 2&#039; animation is nearly the same except the angle of attack differs...<br />
And YES, this one has an edited &#039;Drink Water Canister&#039; animation too...<br />
<br />
NOTE : Some of you may notice there is another (not usable in-game) animation called &#039;Halberd&#039;... <br />
This animation is an attack sequence with the model slashing down with his spear...<br />
It is left in the model in-case anyone wanted to switch the spear for a halberd...<br />
But mind you, this model have 2 spear geosets... So do the switch properly...<br />
