<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So, here is something i i did with Tranquil&#039;s Captain model. He gave me permission to edit his model, so  credit goes to him, too. <blockquote><div>Tranquil</div>you have my permission. In fact you can edit all of my models.</blockquote>Update:<br />

Wrapped the cape more better, the lion is moved up a little.<br />
Changed the shoulderpad&#039;s texture.<br />
Updated screenshot.<br />
