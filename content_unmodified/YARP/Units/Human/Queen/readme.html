<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Royal Queen<br />
<br />
Model by: Dan van Ohllus (aka Kuhneghetz)<br />
<br />
Descriptions:<br />
A queen is a qualifying reference to a female monarch, possessing and exercising all of the monarchical powers of a ruler.<br />
This interpretion of a queen is inspired by an amount of queens from the victorian era, thus she has that pale make-up on her face.<br />
<br />
Model descriptions:<br />
Head and upper body is based on Villager Woman. Crown, collar, skirt and scepter are made from scratch.<br />
Animations taken from wc3 units.<br />
Portrait model is included.<br />
100% ingame textures.<br />

UPDATE:<br />
Removed some unnecessary stuffs on the portrait model, such as unused bones and unviewable meshes.<br />
<br />
UPDATE2:<br />
- Grayhaired eyebrows added to match with the queen&#039;s haircolour.<br />
- &quot;Sideburns&quot; on her cheeks removed.<br />
- Bottom part of the neckles has been altered a bit.<br />
If you&#039;ve downloaded this model before the update, download this model again because she looks better now.<br />
I also updated the corresponding icon to match with the model.<br />
