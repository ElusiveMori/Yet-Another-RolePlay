<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As the name of the model isn&#039;t obvious enough, this is a female Human mage unit that is based on the Jaina model. This model includes full Decay animations as this is intended to be a regular unit rather thn a hero, and could be useful as a Human replacement for the Elven Sorceress.<br />
<br />
This model uses ingame textures, so no need to worry about texture paths. Just simply import both the model and the portrait into your custom map!<br />
<br />
If you want to use this model then feel free to do that, provided that you&#039;ll give credit to me in return.<br />

<b>UPDATE 1:</b><br />
A new update. Changes include...<br />
<br />
<i>- Some meshes have been ajusted and/or given new textures. Several UV wraps have also been re-adjusted as well.<br />
- Bones and animations have been tweaked to look a little better and also to minimise clipping issues.<br />
- The left arm now matches the right one.</i><br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 1.5:</b><br />
The small detail between the breasts now disappears during the Decay Bone animation. I don&#039;t even know how I&#039;ve even missed that before, but it should be fixed now.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 2:</b><br />
Recalculated extents.<br />
