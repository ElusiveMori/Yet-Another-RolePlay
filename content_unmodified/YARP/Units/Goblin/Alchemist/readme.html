<h2>Vermillion Edict's Goblin Alchemist</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A model made on request.<br />
<br />
Feel free to edit this model, but remember to credit me.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Fixed death &amp; dissipate anims.<br />
EDIT2:<br />
A sound object was left Unnamed, and will cause the same problems as the lack of a custom skin, extra geoset animations or Materials. I would advise any other modellers to reload their saved models and check the sound objects for this glitch, as sometimes they will cause an animation to go blank, or simply refues to be assigned.<br />
