<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All right, so here we go again... i really enjoyed making the greek set, and figured i&#039;d make a celtic set to go with it. I wanted to avoid using the yellow farm roof - since it&#039;s used on literally every single custom wc3 structure since the dawn of time - so i ended up using Arthas&#039; hair instead, with some vertex coloring to make it look like a thatched roof. I hope he doesn&#039;t mind. Note that it probably won&#039;t display properly in the viewer, so test it ingame for the real deal.</p>
