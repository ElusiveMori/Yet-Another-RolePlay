<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my pack of fortification buildings for my wall system. I made them to have buildable and walkable walls (via triggers) with different animations for each level of destruction (see description of the different models). The wall system also features the abillity to turn the walls before building and has a height adjustment system, raising/lowering the terrain beneath the walls gradually to avoid big height differences between the wall sections.<br />
<br />
I also made a <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps-564/castle-defence-241169/" class="internalLink">presentation map</a> with the wall system. There you can see how the models are intended to work (with some basic gameplay for testing and fun <img src="/forums/images_all/smilies/winkg.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":wink:" title="Wink    :wink:" />).<br />
<br />
The models only uses ingame textures (for low filesize), have a portrait camera and team colour.<br />
