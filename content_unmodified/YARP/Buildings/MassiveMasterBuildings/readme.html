<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This pack contains all the medieval builduings I made so far. More will be added as soon as I finish them. I also made some fortification buildings which are supposed to go along with these models. They are in a separate pack that can be found <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/packs-542/fortification-buildings-213196/?prev=search%3DMedieval%2520buildings%26d%3Dlist%26r%3D20" class="internalLink">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The models only uses ingame textures (for low filesize), have a portrait camera and team colour.<br />
