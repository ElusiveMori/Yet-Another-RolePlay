<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lots of people have requested me to extend my Minas Tirith set, so here comes some more models for it.<br />
<br />
I am not 100% sure if the scaling is good, but it is consistent with the other models. In any case you will propably rescale them yourselves in the editor.<br />
<br />
If you want some great examples on how you can use my gondorian set, i recommend you check out Herbert09&#039;s Minas Tirith terrain <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/members/232654-albums7167-picture80643.html" class="internalLink">here</a>.<br />
